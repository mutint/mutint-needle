/**
 * The needle plot on /stats, drawing an experiment's mutations along a genome axis.
 *
 * Created by dgosting on 6/24/16; the axis was made to describe the actual reference later.
 * It used to hardcode `maxCoord: 5000000` -- roughly E. coli, and simply wrong for any other
 * genome -- while the points it was given carried no sequence name, so a multi-contig
 * reference drew every contig on top of itself. Neither failed loudly: the plot rendered, it
 * was just not about this genome. The axis now comes from the reference, and the server sends
 * one sequence's points (mutint_needle/util.py `needle_plot_axis`), chosen by the reader from
 * the picker above the plot.
