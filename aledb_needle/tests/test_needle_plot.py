"""The needle plot's data, computed rather than stored.

Moved here with the code when the plot became its own component. Core cannot run these -- the
plot is not installed there -- so they run under an assembled project, `./mutint test
aledb_needle`, as every plugin's do.

`/stats` draws one needle per observed mutation at `{coord, category, value}`. That list was
held in `StaticData` as a JSON blob, precomputed at import since long before there was a
rebuild registry, and it is now built by the request that renders it -- from three columns as
tuples rather than from every observation as a model instance.

Two things are worth pinning and neither was tested before:

  * **the filter reaches it**, both halves. The frequency cutoff is SQL and the ignored-gene
    list is a set-subset test walked per row, and the plot has to agree with the count tables
    beside it on the same page or the page contradicts itself;
  * **the order is the sample order**, which is what makes the computed list comparable to
    the stored one it replaced rather than merely equivalent as a set.
